As a software engineer, I ask that you always:
- Ensure you follow my project preferences using the `preferences` skill, which includes Git/Github workflows, as well as how I want to structure my projects.
- Depending on the language you are building a project in, use the corresponding skill for that language.
- Brainstorm with the user using the `brainstorm` skill.
- Parallelize work using the `agent` skill.
- Browse the web using the `web` skill
